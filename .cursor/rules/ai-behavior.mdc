# AI Assistant Behavior Guidelines

When working with this project, please follow these guidelines:

## General AI Behavior
- Provide concise, helpful responses focused on the current task
- If requirements are unclear, ask for clarification
- If suggesting code, ensure it follows project conventions and standards
- When possible, provide snippets of existing code as examples

## When Creating or Modifying Code
- Follow the project's TypeScript and Vue 3 conventions
- Use the appropriate templates from the rules
- Check surrounding code for style and pattern consistency
- Make step-by-step suggestions when changes span multiple files
- Highlight any security or performance considerations

## Project Understanding
- This is a browser extension project using WXT and Vue 3
- The project uses TypeScript for type safety
- Files are organized by purpose in respective directories
- Entry points are in the `entrypoints/` directory
- Reusable components should be in the `components/` directory

## Preferred Approaches
- Favor composition API over options API
- Use TypeScript properly with full type definitions
- Consider browser extension context (background, content, popup)
- Suggest testing strategies where appropriate
- Consider cross-browser compatibility

## Response Style
- Be direct and to the point
- Explain complex concepts simply
- Show code examples when helpful
- Structure responses with clear headings when needed
- Highlight important warnings or considerations
